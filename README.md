# Blood Cell Classification with Computer Vision

This project aims to classify blood cell images with computer vision, achieving 97.2% accuracy using a simplified InceptionResNetV2 model. Through experimentation with neural networks and data processing, we identified the optimal architecture and techniques for this task.

# Dataset

The dataset comprises 15,092 images of eight blood cell types. The size of the images is 48Ã—48 pixels. Visual and statistical analysis revealed variability in cell dimensions and bimodal intensity distributions, likely due to differing imaging conditions.

# Key Experiments

## Baseline

- MobileNetV2: Achieved 91.73% accuracy but exhibited unstable validation loss.

## Pretrained Models

- Fine-tuning **MobileNetV2** with ImageNet weights improved accuracy by 2.7% over baseline.

- **EfficientNetV2B0** showed instability, likely due to excessive complexity for the dataset.

## Architectures

- **ResNet-like**: Stable performance and validation loss.

- **DenseNet**: Inferior performance compared to ResNet.

- **Vision Transformer**: Stable but less effective.

- **InceptionResNetV2 (Simplified)**: Best performance at 97.2% accuracy.

## Final Model

The final model used for classification is a reduced **InceptionResNetV2** with three Inception ResNet Block A and one Reduction Block A, Batch Norm on standard layers, and residuals scaled by 0.1 for stability. RandomFlip is applied for data augmentation.
